      <h1>Our goal? You want to know our goal?</h1>
      <h1>Our main goal is to help people code.</h1>
      <h2>But our second goal..
      <br>Our second goal, Is much MUCH bigger.
      <br>Our second goal is to travel to space. Not by NASA, Or the goverment.
      <br>We want to build, an launch our own rocket and satellite.
      <br>We have done research and found that is it completely legal to launch a satellite into space.
      <br>We also hope that goverments of different countrys don't shoot down our satellite. That would suck..
